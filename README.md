## Emanuele Lapponi

### TL;DR

Strong NLP game: designing and evaluating supervised and unsupervised machine
learning systems, implementing state-of-the-art NLP tools, experience with
large-scale jobs on computing clusters as well as system development. Fluent
in Python, Java, and the UNIX shell. Published NLP work in peer-reviewed conferences
and journals.

### Employment 

- 2012-2018 (expected): PhD Research Fellow in NLP, University of Oslo

> My PhD work is partly funded by the [CLARINO project](https://clarin.w.uib.no/), whose mission is facilitating
access to NLP tools and resources for researchers in the Social Sciences and the Humanities.
Key contributions of the project:
> - Creating a scalable interchange format for [the Language Analysis Portal](lap.clarino.uio.no)
> - Collaboration with the Department of Political Science, creating and researching the [Talk of Norway data set](https://github.com/ltgoslo/talk-of-norway)

- 2014-2015: Researcher, [CLARINO](https://clarin.w.uib.no/)

> I was "bought out" of my PhD for about a year to continue designing and developing the [the Language Analysis Portal](lap.clarino.uio.no), a point-and-click interface for combining NLP tools and
annotating text with linguistic annotations. I worked with a team of 4 developers at all levels,
from database design and implementation to tool integration and graphical user interface.

- 2017: Researcher, [NLPL](https://neic.no/nlpl/)

> I was hired for 3 months as researcher to develop [the Sherlock system](https://github.com/ltgoslo/sherlock). This is an open source release of the system I developed as a master student,
which ranked first and second on the two tracks of the 2012 [\*SEM shared task on negation resolution](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/sem2012-st-neg/). Sherlock was used as a tool to
evaluate parser outputs in the [2017 EPE shared task](http://epe.nlpl.eu/).

- 2011: Developer, [cXense](https://www.cxense.com/)

> Summer job at an NLP-centric startup, where I worked on live data visualization as well as creating a tool for sentiment analysis (and integrating it in their Java stack).

- 2010-2012: Teaching Assistant, University of Oslo

> I was a TA in the [Algorithms and Data
Structures](http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/INF2220/) class. I also
TA'ed the [introductory course on interaction
design](http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/INF1510/), where I was also
tasked with developing obligatory assignments using [Processing](https://processing.org/) and [Arduinos](https://www.arduino.cc/).

### Education 

- M.Sc.: Computer Science, University of Oslo, 2012
> Thesis focus: Negation Resolution and Sentiment Analysis.

- B.Sc.: Computer Science, University of Oslo, 2010

### Key skills

- Python stack for NLP/Data Science: scikit learn, gensim, pandas, numpy and others
- Broad knowledge of tools for linguistic pre-processing, from tokenization to syntacto-semantic analysis
- Academic writing and presentation, communicating results and ideas
- Fluent in Italian, Norwegian and English
